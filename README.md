# Hello =D :

## I'm Gerardo AJF:
### A hobbiest programer

that:

- live in 🇸🇻 El Salvador 🇸🇻, country from LatinoAmérica 🌎 
- learn Python 🐍, Artificial Intelligence 🤖, and SQL 🗄️
- want to learn C++ 🐬 and Desktop Apps 🖥️

In the quarantine due to Covid-19 🦠, I decided to learn programming for all the free time I had, so I downloaded Python 🐍 and started watching YouTube 📹 videos. And I think my knowledge 📚 has matured quite a bit compared to what I knew in 2020, although it is never too much knowledge :P.

## TODO:

- I don't have any public projects 📦, and I think it would be good to apply my knowledge in Python 🐍 packages
- Finish PyContacts
